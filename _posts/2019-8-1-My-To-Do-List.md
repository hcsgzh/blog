- Self-teaching plan and material at https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university

- C++ learning


### List of things 

- Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects 9th

- Beginning Linux Programming, 4 Ed

### Plan first

Clear mind and make the goal clearer.

You need to know there are lots of things needed to learn but your time is limited. So make a plan and Todo list with priorities.
